In this project, we investigate the predictability of users' location traces, using predictive models to impute the users' data gaps. In geospatial studies, a considerable amount of users' records are filtered due to an insufficient amount of records, which waste study resources. However, these missing records can be imputed using predictive models leading to preserve more users in the study.
